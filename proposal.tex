% Latex is used to generate professionally typeset documents. It's different
% from word processors like Microsoft Word in that it separates style from
% content. It is designed to let you write your document without worrying too
% much about fonts, positioning of figures and tables, and what the document
% should look like. Latex uses a set of well-established rules to decide these
% things.

% Latex files are text files where most of the content is the words, sentences,
% and paragraphs. When complete, latex files are fed into the pdflatex program
% to create a pdf - we usually call this compiling the document.

% Within the text you can put comments and commands. These lines are comments.
% On any line, everything after a percent sign (%) is treated as a comment.
% Comments don't have any effect on the output file.

% Commands start with a backslash. The first command is usually \documentclass,
% as below. It tells latex the type of document to generate: book, article,
% letter, etc. Commands can take parameters and/or options.

% Parameters appear in curly braces after the command. Options appear in square
% brackets between the command and the parameters. The \documentclass command
% below has "article" as a parameter and "a4paper" as one option. Multiple
% options are separated by commas.

% Latex is built on a language called TeX. TeX is a simple language with only a
% few built-in commands. TeX allows us to create our own commands. LaTeX is a
% huge collection of such programmer-created commands in one handy package.

% There are only a few types of document built-in to latex, like article.
% If you google "latex article options" you'll find lots of sites listing
% what each option does.
\documentclass[12pt, a4paper, oneside, openany, dvipsnames, hidelinks]{article}

  % Lot's of latex programmers have created extra packages for Latex.
  % They're not enabled by default as they affect the length of time it takes
  % to compile the document. They can enable things like colour and hyperlinks
  % in the output pdf. The \usepackage command will include a package, so long
  % as it is installed along with latex. TeXLive include lots of standard
  % packages by default. Google "latex minted" to see what it does.

  % Enables the use of colour. 
  \usepackage{xcolor}
  % Syntax high-lighting for code. Requires Python's pygments.

  % The tikz package allows us to create diagrams and plots using latex
  % commands. It defines some extra commands, like \usetikzlibrary below.

  % Various tikz libraries.
  % For drawing mind maps.
  \usetikzlibrary{mindmap}
  % For adding shadows.
  \usetikzlibrary{shadows}
  % Extra arrows tips.

  % No prizes for guessing what the following few commands do.

  % GMIT colours.
  \definecolor{gmitblue}{RGB}{20,134,225}
  \definecolor{gmitred}{RGB}{220,20,60}

  % Tell minted to use the following colour scheme. 
  \usemintedstyle{manni}
  % Set some minted options.
  \setminted{frame=lines, framesep=2mm, baselinestretch=1.2, fontsize=\footnotesize, linenos}
  
  % Everything above the below \begin{document} command is referred to as the
  % preamble. The preamble configures the features and styles of the output.
  % The \begin{document} command tells latex we beginning the content of the
  % document - the words, sentences, and paragraphs we want to create.

  % Begin the document.  
  \begin{document}



  % Include the bibliography with IEEE style.
