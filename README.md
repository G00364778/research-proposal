# Research proposal template

This repository contains a template for submitting a research proposal for a
Master's or PhD. The template is designed to also give a tentative introduction
to LaTeX for prospective students.

You may wish to try LaTeX out online before attempting to use this template.
You can do this by signing up to [Overleaf](https://www.overleaf.com/) and
following their [Learn LaTeX in 30 minutes](https://www.overleaf.com/learn/latex/Learn_LaTeX_in_30_minutes).

The repository is designed so that you can both use it as a guide and a template.
There are comments in the code and the content of the document is informative too.

# Prerequisites
1. You'll need LaTeX. The most common way to get LaTeX is to install
   [TeX Live](https://www.tug.org/texlive/).
2. The template can include syntax high-lighted code. To use this feature you
   will need to install [Pygments](http://pygments.org/download/).
3. Pygments requires Python, which I would recommend acquiring through
   [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual).
4. I recommend you use [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/).
5. Within Visual Studio Code I recommend installing the [LaTeX Workshop](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=James-Yu.latex-workshop) plugin.
6. I recommend you use [git](https://git-scm.com/) to keep track of your work.
