# This bibtex file is used to accurately generate a list of references when compiling the latex document.
# Each journal article, book, website, whatever should have its own entry in here.
# You generally don't write these entries by hand for a given item.
# The websites for most journals will automatically generate the entry, which you can copy and paste.

# Each entry in here will not neccessarily end up in your compiled document.
# They are only included if the \cite{} command is used in your latex files with the name of the entry.
# Generally the items appear in the list of references in the order they appear in your latex files.

# You can re-use the same .bib file for all of your different latex works.
# It just might end up a bit lengthy.
